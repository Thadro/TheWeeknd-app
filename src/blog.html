                    <p>On the afternoon of March 5, the artist known as The Weeknd is at a rehearsal for his appearance on what will be the last live episode of “Saturday Night Live” for the foreseeable future — although no one realizes it at the time. The iconic Studio 8H at 30 Rock bustles with activity as he prepares to run through his two performances and tape promos for the show with cast member Cecily Strong and host Daniel Craig, whose next James Bond film, “No Time to Die,” has just been postponed from an April release date to November due to the rapidly spreading coronavirus pandemic.
                    </p>
                    <p>Apart from a couple of stagehands wearing gloves or surgical masks, there’s little indication of the panic that’s just days away. Dozens of people move around the small space, and there are hugs, handshakes and close contact all around, including when Weeknd (real name: Abel Tesfaye) and Craig meet for the first time and exchange several minutes of friendly chat. “I just totally geeked out on Daniel Craig,” he is heard confessing to a team member afterward.</p>
                    <p>The Weeknd, Craig and Strong gather in front of the show’s famous stage to tape the promos, one of which makes a light joke about coronavirus isolation in the show’s trademark off-hand yet envelope-pushing manner.</p>

                    <p>After “Heartless" and “Blinding Lights," the US prodigy has just released his song "After Hours," another single from the long-awaited new album.</p>
                    <p>Since 2018 and the very successful My Dear Melancholy, The Weeknd has kept us waiting. The US artist stired up all his fans on November 27 by releasing his brand new track Heartless in which he talks about sex, addiction and thwarted love.</p>
                    <p>A long awaited new album</p>
                    <p>The Weeknd is back! The American prodigy unveiled his new song Heartless on all music platforms. A song full of melancholy that speaks of a broken heart, a bruised body and a lost love. A reference to his roller-coaster love with Bella Hadid? Then came Blinding Lights, heard in an advertisement for a car brand, and now After Hours, released on February 19. A song that we know must be important since it bears the name of The Weeknd's new album, which is set to be released on March 20th.</p>

                    <p>It was showtime on a fuzzy July evening in 2011 and I was standing on the floor at the Mod Club in Toronto’s Little Italy for the Weeknd’s debut performance. I had never felt more alive. In front of his three-piece band, he was wearing an army print jacket rolled up to his elbows with a beaded bracelet hugging his right wrist. He seemed a little scared but no one in the audience cared. Four months after the release of the Weeknd’s debut mixtape, House of Balloons, we were just happy to be there, aglow in the presence of a then-mysterious artist music bloggers called “experimental.”</p>
                    <p>Aliveness was wafting all around me. About 600 of us became a “we” for 90 minutes that night. We—a group of self-described misfits, young Canadian fanatics—were finally joiners. Just days before, the indie weekly Now Magazine called the concert “easily the most anticipated first show by a Toronto act. Ever.” We were watching his every move. Drake was watching from the balcony, people whispered, and so were some major music execs. The very local singer Massari tweeted, “The man is a legend in the making. Even Puffys [sic] People are in the Green Room with us lol amazing!!” But there was nothing funny about the fact that all this hype was happening where we lived. For once we were not on the outside looking in, but inside and looking at each other.</p>
                    <p>“The best word I can think of to describe how I felt that night is euphoria,” the Weeknd, born Abel Tesfaye, tells me over email. “All those screaming fans were there to see me and I was overwhelmed. I was terrified, nervous, anxious and then when I sang the first note I felt euphoria. I was comfortable. I knew I was gonna do this for the rest of my life but I’ll never be able to duplicate that feeling.”</p>
